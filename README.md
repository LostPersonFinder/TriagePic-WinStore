TriagePic-WinStore

==================



TriagePic-WinStore is a Windows 8.1 Store version of TriagePic. TriagePic is designed to capture photos and minimal information about mass casualty arrivals at a hospital triage station.  Data is reported by web services to a (typically) hospital-hosted version of NLM's "TriageTrak", where family reunification and other hospital staffers may consult it.  The unmodified code reports to NLM's instance of TriageTrak, for demonstration and evaluation purposes.  For more, see the github project wiki.
