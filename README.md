TriagePic-WinStore

==================



TriagePic-WinStore is a planned Windows Store version of TriagePic. The latter is designed to capture photos and minimal information about mass casualty arrivals at a hospital triage station.  Data is reported by web services to a (typically) hospital-hosted version of NLM's People Locator, referred to as "TriageTrak", where family reunification and other hospital staffers may consult it.  People Locator is related to open-source "Vesuvius" from Sahana Software Foundation.
